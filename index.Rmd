### Introduction 

Hello, welcome to my website, and my name is Chee Kay Cheong. I am a second-year MPH student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, 
and I am in the Epidemiology Department. I will be graduating in May, 2022, and I hope to work in the government sector in the future. 


### Favorite Sticker

I want to introduce to you my favorite sticker. The white panda named "YiEr" and the brown bear named "BuBu". They are a pair of cute couple. 

I used their stickers all the time in WeChat.

This is how I look like when I do my P8105 Data Science homework.

### Problem 1

I created a page consisting of a brief summary of my academic and professional experience. Click on this [brief resume](Resume.html) to take a quick look at it.

There should also be a file icon on the navigation bar that can lead you to the same page.


### Problem 2

I also created a flexdashboard using `plotly` that includes three distinct plot types and a table using the [NYC Restaurant Inspections](https://p8105.com/dataset_restaurant_inspections.html) datasets,
which is loaded from the `p8105.datasets` package.


This [page](Plot.html) contains all the datasets and codes I used to create plots and table on the [dashboard](Dashboard.html).
