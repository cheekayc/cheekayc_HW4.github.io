This website is created for the purpose of P8105 Homework 4.

This website contains:

* a page with brief summary of my academic and professional experience 

* a page with all the datasets and codes to create plots to put on the dashboard page

* a dashboard page with three plots and a table that provide some interesting information about NYC restaurant inspections

* some links to my GitHub account and my email on the navigation bar.


#### p.s.
I don't have other professional networks as I forgot my LinkedIn password. It may take a while to retrieve my LinkedIn account, so I might include that in this website in the future.
